**Abstract**

This paper proposes an analysis of air pollution trends across U.S. presidencies to examine the influence of political leadership on climate change. Leveraging data from the “Datasets APIs and open source projects related to Climate Change” GitHub repository, we aim to investigate whether Republican presidents are more likely to produce higher levels of air pollution. Additionally, we seek to forecast potential air pollution levels during a second Trump presidency. Time permitting, we will also explore the impact of party affiliation on air pollution at the state level. Through this analysis, we aim to identify the ways in which political policies have influenced environmental outcomes, highlighting both effective and harmful practices in the fight against climate change.
