# Climate Data Review: Entry 1

## Step 1: Reviewing the GitHub Repository

For our first step, we reviewed this GitHub repository as recommended by the class syllabus: **Datasets, APIs, and Open Source Projects Related to Climate Change**.  

As we parsed through the repository, we—like the repo itself—categorized resources into **APIs** and **Databases**. Our initial conclusions were as follows:

### Key Observations

1. **APIs require detailed documentation and are not always free.** Databases will be our preferred choice for accessing geo-longitudinal air quality data due to their reliability and accessibility.  
2. **We prioritized air quality data** but also included CO₂ and methane emissions as complementary datasets.  
3. **There is more than enough data for our needs** (at least at first glance). Our approach will be **top-down**, meaning we will start with the most robust datasets and, as time allows, explore additional sources to strengthen our analysis. Not all APIs or datasets will be used, but we aim to incorporate as many relevant ones as possible.  
4. **Many datasets include overlapping information** from other sources, making them non-unique. We will keep this in mind and consolidate data where necessary as we progress.

## APIs

- **Air Quality Programmatic APIs** – Free but has unclear documentation.  
- **AirVisual Platform** – Robust, easy to understand, and free.  
- **BreezoMeter** – Pricing unclear, sparse documentation.  
- **OpenAQ API Docs** – Limited and complex platform.  
- **Carbon Intensity API** – Reliable and robust; useful as a secondary source for indirect air pollution insights.

## Databases

- **CO₂ Emissions from Fossil Fuels since 1751 (by Nation)** – Reliable; minimal documentation concerns.  
- **CO₂ PPM - Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide** – Same as above.  
- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions per 1,000 Kilocalories** – Same as above.  
- **Hockeystick (R Package)** – Same as above.  
- **How Many Gigatons of Carbon Dioxide...?** – Same as above.  
- **CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions** – Same as above.

# Climate Data Review: Entry 2
## Potential Questions to Answer:
- US vs. rest of the world (and based on election)
- US across presidencies
- State by state across elections
- County by county across elections
- Assuming endogenous values, the state of the US in 20 years...

# Climate Data Review: Entry 3
- Met with Judah to discuss the project.
- Going to submit a draft to him
- From what it seems, our project has pivoted such that it now:
  - Investigates airpollution across countries across time
  - Find countries that have a steady politics, where party changes are rare, juxtapose those with countries where parties change off. See if there's a fluctuation in the increase in airpllution in those regions and use an unsupervised method to narrow it down to political affiliation.
